# Kitomba-Coding-Challenge-Problem-3-Mars-Rover

I have chosen problem three, the Mars rover. For this challenge, I used Java.

To run this program, run the main method in the main class. Enter the instructions in the correct form at the command line and the programm will show the results of the rover locations. It is assumed that all instructions will be of the correct form, and that two rovers can occupy the same space.
